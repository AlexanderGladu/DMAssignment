The reason that I chose this license was because it seemed to be the most fitting. 
It is the GNU General Public License, version 2. Out of all of the licenses that I found, this one seemed to be the most
open source code oriented. It focuses on being able to share the software in question, and make changes
to any software under the same license. All of these things make it seem to be the proper license choice
for software that is posted on GitHub, where it can be accessed publicly.
